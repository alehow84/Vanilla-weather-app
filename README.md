## Vanilla JS Weather App ðŸŒž

*Overview*

This is the second project I completed with [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/) front-end development workshop.

The intention of this project was to get to grips with using Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a basic weather app.
The app also utilises axios to make calls to the SheCodes weather forecast API to populate the relevant sections of the app with weather forecast data.

The hosted version of this app can be found here: [Vanilla-weather-app](https://phenomenal-genie-a596d5.netlify.app)
